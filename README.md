### Future Roadmap

- Expanded component tests to include E2E testing for pages
- Add search and filtering functionality
- Update error handling to include clearer messaging and paths to resolutions
- Update list count on resize instead of only page reload
- Add handling for dark mode and motion disabling

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
